# The main focus of this project revolves around the constant issue of modern spam emails and the countermeasure study of spam mail identification. Fraudulent companies, scammers, and robocalls often find a way to get a hold of email addresses somehow and exploit that. As a result, they flood everyoneâ€™s email inbox with a myriad of irrelevant information. To counter this exploitation, large corporations have implemented their own email filtering system to detect and identify suspicious emails, whether it actually does contain a harmful computer virus or spam email, and separate those emails from actual useful emails for individuals. Such big public companies like Google have their own Gmail system with built-in spam email recognition and filtering to reduce the chances of people falling for suspicious spam emails. This project dives deeper into the internal design system of spam email recognition and filtering system. To do so, a dataset provided by the University of California at Irvine and Hewlett-Packard is used to examine the filtering classification algorithm. The dataset is used for Hewlett-Packard Internal-only Technical Report; therefore, it only contains sensitive keywords that Hewlett-Packard requires.
